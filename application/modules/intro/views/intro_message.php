				<li><a href="https://github.com/fatihbazman" target="_blank">Fatih Bazman</a> for his work with something very similar to what we have been working on. I don't know how best to communicate with you (language barriers) but I thank you none-the-less. Your work with HMVC helped me figure out some thoughts on authentication. Also, your example 'layouts' were very helpful and made me think of my training on Backbone Boilerplate with Tim from Bocoup.</li>
